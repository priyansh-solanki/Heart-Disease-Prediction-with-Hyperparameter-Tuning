# Heart Disease Prediction with Hyperparameter Tuning
- Orchestrated the development of an entropy-based Decision Tree model to predict heart disease, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of more than 94%.
- Performed Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search Cross-Validation algorithm in order to obtain the best values of parameters resulting in 10% more accuracy.
- Visualized the split of Decision Tree gaining access on the workflow of the model in order to accurately understand the concept of branch splits.
